            <h2>What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
            <p>When you hear mechanical keyboard, the first thing that probably comes to mind, is either a massive glowing gamer station or a gimmicky fake typewriter replica. While both descriptions are correct, mechanical keyboards are so much more.</p>

            <p> Mechanical keyboards are comprised of high quality components including spring activated switches, keys, and frames. You can choose the style of base, type of switches, types and colors of keys, and the layout of the keys. All these features allow the user to create the look and feel they prefer.</p>
